        question: "Who can enroll in RoboAiQ?",
        answer: "Students aged 10 to 18 can enroll. They are placed into beginner, intermediate, or advanced batches after a short skill assessment covering basic logic, math readiness, and interest in electronics or coding."
    },
    {
        id: 3,
        question: "What technologies are used in training?",
        answer: "Training platforms include Arduino Uno and ESP32 microcontrollers, ultrasonic and IR sensors, DC and servo motors, L298N motor drivers, Bluetooth and WiFi modules, and standard C and C++ development environments."
    },
    {
        id: 4,
        question: "What projects will students build?",
        answer: "Students build a line-following robot, an obstacle-avoidance system, a Bluetooth-controlled vehicle, an ESP32 WiFi robot with a live control interface, and a final autonomous navigation robot with sensor-based decision logic."
    },
    {
        id: 5,
        question: "What is the training style like?",
        answer: "Classes follow a build, test, and optimize cycle involving live circuit wiring, real-time code uploads, serial debugging, sensor calibration, and physical robot performance tuning."
    },
    {
        id: 6,
        question: "What comes in the robotics kit?",
        answer: "Each student receives a take-home kit including an Arduino Uno, ESP32, robot chassis, wheels, DC motors, servo motors, motor driver board, breadboard, jumper wires, battery pack, ultrasonic and IR sensors, LEDs, resistors, and a USB programming cable."

        question: "Do you support robotics competitions?",
        answer: "Yes. Preparation includes arena simulation, rule-based scoring analysis, speed and accuracy tuning, teamwork role assignment, and formal technical presentation practice for regional and international events."
    },
    {
        id: 8,
        question: "Who are the mentors?",
        answer: "Instruction is led by robotics engineers and IIT-trained educators with experience in international robotics competitions, embedded systems development, and student competition coaching."
    },
    {
        id: 9,
        question: "How is student progress tracked?",
        answer: "Student performance is measured through weekly hardware build checkpoints, code reviews, sensor accuracy tests, robot speed trials, and a final evaluated project demonstration."
    },
    {
        id: 10,
        question: "How can I book a demo or enroll?",
        answer: "Free demo sessions can be scheduled by phone at 8971252285, by email at Sales@werrcm.in, or through the website enquiry form for direct admissions support."
